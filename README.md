# Binary-Classification-using-keras
# Project Title

This project executes binary classification with the [make_moon dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_moons.html) using keras Neural network library.

### Prerequisites

The prerequisites to executing this code include, installing scikit learn (for importing dataset), keras for the classification and tensorflow to execute [callbacks](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/TensorBoard)

```
Scikit-Learn
Keras
tensorflow
```

### Installing Dependencies
To install the dependencies to run this code,   
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)  
[keras](https://keras.io/)  
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)  
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install Keras
```
For TensorFlow alone, follow the instruction in the link as it requires creating a virtual environment to run.


## Running the code

To run the code, download the file, and open [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/try) to run the code. Execute the first cell to check whether the dependencies are installed properly. Then execute the rest of the code to visually observe the classification.
